<center>The person I admire is Elon Musk. He is a very successful man. He is an engineer, entrepreneur and investor. He believes that we need to colonize other planets to secure the future of humanity from numerous risks. And he is not just a dreamer but a man of action. He founded SpaceX company, which already succeeded in reducing the cost of space flights. 

Musk is a rich man now. But he did not inherit the fortune or win the lottery. He earned the money by developing innovative businesses. In youth he founded a software company called Zip2 with his brother. Later he sold it and became a cofounder of X.com company. Now we know it as PayPal. It is a popular service of online payments and money transfers. Also Elon Musk became a CEO of Tesla Inc. which produces electro cars.

Who can be more inspiring, than a person literally shaping our future? Elon Musk makes the science fiction come true. A few years ago he founded Neuralink company to develop implantable brain-machine interfaces. Such implants will give people capabilities they never had before.

One of Muskâ€™s projects is called Hyperloop. He is going to build new high-speed transportation system, where pods will move in reduced-pressure tubes.

Most people have pretty down to earth life goals. Elon Musk stands out because he is a strategic thinker and he is concerned about the future of the whole mankind. I am very excited about all his projects. I hope eventually his plans will be implemented.</center>
