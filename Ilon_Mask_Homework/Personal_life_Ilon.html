Personal life
The first wife, Justin Wilson, studied with him at the same university in Canada. They got married in 2000 and had five children.

In September 2008, Elon and Justin announced the breakup as Musk began dating British actress Talulah Riley. They got married in 2010. Musk and Riley divorced in 2012, but got married again in 2013. In March 2016, they filed for divorce, which took place in October of the same year.

Elon Musk admitted that he has problems with sleep and uses the sleeping pill "Ambien" (zolpidem).

He dated actress Amber Heard for about a year. Musk explained in an Instagram comment that the reason for their separation was tight work schedules and long-distance relationships, but he and Hurd remain friends.

In February 2020, Amber Heard's ex-husband, Johnny Depp, announced that Heard began cheating on him with Musk a month after the wedding. The case file contains testimony from witnesses who stated that Musk visited Heard's Penthouse more than once in the absence of her husband. The court demanded that Elon Musk show all personal communication with Hurd in order to examine the validity of these charges. Representatives of the businessman released a statement denying and claiming that the relationship remained friendly until Hurd and Depp's official divorce. Musk is known to be one of Amber Heard's witnesses in a domestic violence case.

Since 2018 he has been dating Canadian singer and musician Claire Boucher, better known as Grimes [34]. In January 2020, Grimes confirmed that she and Musk were expecting their first child. Grimes explained that the child will be able to choose his own gender and the couple plans to use the neutral pronoun "they" in relation to the child. The couple's firstborn was born on May 4, 2020; according to his father, his name is "X Æ A-12", although in California this name may be illegal because it contains a character that is not an English letter (Æ). Approximate transcription - "Ex Ash Hey-Twelv".

Ilona's younger brother, Kimbal, is a successful restaurateur, an adherent of the use of farm products, and his sister Tosca is engaged in film production. May Musk, Ilona's mother, is also a well-known public figure, a successful model, lecturer and nutritionist.

Moved from California to Texas at the end of 2020.
